Behind the scenes, the system treats AutoFill as a separate app, independent from the main KeePassium process. For security reasons, an app cannot simply access any external files – unless you explicitly link these files to that app. Thus the system guarantees that the app can only access the few files you allowed it to.\n\nAs a result, both AutoFill and the main KeePassium app need to be given their own permissions for each external file. Luckily, this is a one-time procedure.",
